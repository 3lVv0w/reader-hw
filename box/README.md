plexiglass-slide-9cm
--------------------

For individual production using a laser cutter.

A plexiglass "sandwich" -- cut out every layer, stick together with some plexiglass solvent (e.g. acetone) or superglue.

Optimized to fit existing holes at FMFI.

**Notes on cutting:**

- Layers 1, 2 and 6 (6 is the unlabeled one) are to be cut from 3mm plexiglass, layers 3, 4 and 5 from 5mm plexiglass.
- The black-filled areas need to be rastered to about 1mm depth.

**Notes on sticking:**

- Actually, sticking the layers together has not been tested yet. The following are just educated guesses.
- Be careful with acetone: too much and it will eat your box. Best applied with a syringe to layers slightly pressed together (have faith in capillary action). 
- In order to get a precise fit, guides should be used when sticking it. TODO figure it out and elaborate.
